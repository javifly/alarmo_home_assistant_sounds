# alarmo_home_assistant_sounds
mp3 sounds for use with the "alarm" feature of your home assistant device

With the addon "file editor" of your "home assistant" leave the mp3 files in the path /homeassistant/www/audio 

To play them create a script that calls the media player service with the option to play media content.  Choose your device (tablet, google home...) and the path where these mp3 sounds are located.

The path of the sounds is written like this: https://pepe.duckdns.org:8111/local/audio/alarma_la_alarma_esta_armada.mp3
